I struggled to connect the js file with the html. I learnt how it works in the background of websites other than what we see through our eyes.

JavaScript files add interactivity to your website using code. This is where you can listen for events, then take an action.

### ‚Üê assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project. You do not need to add anything to this folder unless you are working on the extensions. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg`.
